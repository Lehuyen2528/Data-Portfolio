# Project Objective
The primary aim of this project is to gain practical experience in exploring, cleaning, and visualizing datasets using Python.

# Procedure
**Part 1:** Inspect and analyze data

In this activity, I will examine data provided and prepared it for analysis. This activity will help ensure the information is,

1. Ready to answer questions and yield insights
2. Ready for visualizations
3. Ready for future hypothesis testing and statistical methods

#### This activity has two parts:

1. Understand the data
- Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis(EDA) and statistical activities.
- Complie summary information about the data to inform next steps

2. Understand the variables
- Use insights from examnination of the summary data to guide deeper investifation into specific variables

**Part 2:**  Exploratory data analysis and data visualization

In this activity, I will clean data set and create a visualization

**Part 3:** Conduct an A/B test

The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount.
