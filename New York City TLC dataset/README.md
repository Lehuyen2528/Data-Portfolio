# Purpose of this project
- Practice Explored, clean and visualize dataset using python
- The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

# Project task
- Explored dataset to find any unusual values.
- Considered which variables are most useful to build predictive models (in this case: total_amount and trip_distance, which work together to depict a taxi cab ride).
- Considered potential interactions between the two chosen variables.
- Examined which components of the provided data will provide relevant insights.
- Built the groundwork for future exploratory data analysis, visualizations.
# Process
1. Conduct a complete exploratory data analysis.
2. Perform any data cleaning and data analysis steps to understand unusual variables (e.g., outliers).
3. Use descriptive statistics to learn more about the data.
